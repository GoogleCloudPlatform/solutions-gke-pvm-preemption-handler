# Using PVMs on GKE to serve user facing applications
This repository contains the code used in the tutorial [Running web applications on GKE using PVMs and Traffic Director](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/running-web-applications-on-gke-using-cost-optimized-pvms-and-traffic-director).

This tutorial demonstrates how to handle preemptions while running [preemptible VMs (PVMs)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible) on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) that is serving a web application. The tutorial walks through setting up a deployment that uses a combination of PVMs and standard VMs on GKE to reliably serve web application traffic without any disruption.
